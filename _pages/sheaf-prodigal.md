# Sheaf: Prodigal

![Side Image](/docs/assets/images/Sheaf6-jpg.png)

Then Scythian warriors did toss their blades,

Unruffled by Orcus' pugnacious shades,

And grasped his brother each in shepherd hug,

A Cossack's embrace flung upon Goth's rug. 

"Behold, we are Khan!" did Uriah roar

To the spectators of butchery's gore.

But Jeshurun did raise Uriah's arm,

Fist by fist clench'ed against Orcus' harm,

And defiance spat: "Brethren, life or death!

Who shall the Khans part? Unto lungs' last breath!

Come then, o world -- we shall sting thee and die!"

Thus Thorn and Stalk did publicize kin's tie.
