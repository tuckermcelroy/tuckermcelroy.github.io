# The Jubilee of Auriel

Liberty. Purpose. Belonging. The Lion-man pursues emancipation through five different worlds: the epic, the futuristic, the fantastic, the mundane, and the celestial. These layers of an incarcerated existence become synthesized as he confronts the crises of liberation, and encounters one who has named him Auriel.
